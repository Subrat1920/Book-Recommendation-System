# **Book Recommendation System**

## **Project Overview**
The **Book Recommendation System** is designed to provide personalized book suggestions to users based on their preferences and past interactions. Using **popular-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering**, the system helps users discover books they may enjoy. The project follows a **modular coding** approach, making it scalable and maintainable.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Streamlit (for web app development)
- **Database:** SQLite3 (for storing user interactions and book metadata)
- **Machine Learning Concepts:**
  - **Popular-Based Filtering:** Recommends books based on their overall popularity.
  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Suggests books based on user behavior and similarities between users.

## **Implementation Approach**
1. **Data Collection & Processing:**
   - Gather book metadata, ratings, and user interactions.
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset for better efficiency.
   
2. **Model Development:**
   - **Popular-Based Filtering:**
     - Uses statistical methods to recommend the most popular books across users.
   - **Collaborative Filtering:**
     - Uses user-item interactions to suggest books based on similar usersâ€™ reading habits.
     
3. **Web Application Development:**
   - Built using **Streamlit** to provide an interactive UI.
   - Users can search books, view recommendations, and rate books.
   
4. **Modular Coding Structure:**
   - Separate modules for data handling, model training, recommendation logic, and UI components.
   - Ensures easy scalability and maintainability.
   
## **Expected Outcome**
- A **user-friendly** web app where users can get **personalized book recommendations**.
- **Efficient and scalable** modular architecture.
- Improved recommendation accuracy using **hybrid filtering techniques**.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Implement **content-based filtering** to improve recommendations.
- Integrate **deep learning models** for better user preference predictions.
- Expand the database with more book details and user interactions.
